# Screen Journal

**Screen Journal** is an iOS app designed to help reduce screen time. By using Apple's automations, opening addictive apps redirects users to Screen Journal. To proceed to the addictive app, users must type out a brief reason (30+ characters) explaining why they want to use the app. Only after completing this step do they have the option to continue or exit.

By encouraging users to reflect on their intentions for using these apps, Screen Journal aims to help people, including myself, take better control of screen time and reduce unproductive phone use.
